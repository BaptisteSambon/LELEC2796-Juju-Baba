## Introduction

This repository contains the codes for the project of the course [LELEC2796 - Wireless Communications](https://uclouvain.be/en-cours-2023-lelec2796) at [UClouvain](https://uclouvain.be/fr/index.html). The goal of this project is to compare the performance of NOMA and CDMA in a wireless communication system. The comparison is based on the BER, the spectral efficiency and the users scalability. The codes are written in Python and use the Sionna library. The results are plotted using Matplotlib.

## How to run

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/BaptisteSambon/LELEC2796-Juju-Baba.git 
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd LELEC2796-Juju-Baba
```

### Requirements

- Clone this repository and move into the cloned directory
- If an error occurs the first time you run the codes, don't panik it's totally normal. Despite an "try expect" method, Sionna is not easy to import. Thus you often need to run the codes two times before seeing the plotted results.
