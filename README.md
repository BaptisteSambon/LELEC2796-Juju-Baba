**Keywords** : NOMA, Non Orthogonal Multiple Access, CDMA, Code Division Multiple Access, BER, SNR, Spectral Efficiency, Users Scalability, LELEC2796, Wireless Communications. 

## Introduction

This repository contains the codes for the project of the course [LELEC2796 - Wireless Communications](https://uclouvain.be/en-cours-2023-lelec2796) at [UClouvain](https://uclouvain.be/fr/index.html). The goal of this project is to compare the performance of NOMA and CDMA in a wireless communication system. The comparison is based on the BER, the spectral efficiency and the users scalability. The codes are written in Python and use the Sionna library. The results are plotted using Matplotlib.

## How to run

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/BaptisteSambon/LELEC2796-Juju-Baba.git 
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd LELEC2796-Juju-Baba
```

### Requirements

To run the codes, you need to install the following libraries:

- [Sionna](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/)
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [Termcolor](https://pypi.org/project/termcolor/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

Sionna is a library developed by the [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/) team. It is a library for simulating wireless communication systems. It is based on the [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) library. It is a very powerful library but it is not easy to install. To install it, you need to follow the instructions on the [Sionna website](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/installation.html).


> [!TIP]\
> If an error occurs the first time you run the import cell in the notebooks, don't panic it's totally fine. Despite a "try expect" method, Sionna is not easy to import. Thus you often need to run the codes two times before seeing the plotted results.

> [!NOTE]\
> The codes were written in Python 3.8.5. They were tested on Windows 10. They should work on any operating system and any version of Python 3. However, we cannot guarantee that they will work on your computer. If you encounter any problem, please contact us.

> [!IMPORTANT]\
> The variables and parameters used for the simulations are defined in the first cell of the notebooks. You can change them to see the impact on the results.
